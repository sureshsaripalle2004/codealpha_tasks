Obtained 918 unique records for further analysis.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis
The following analyses were performed:

Target-class distribution analysis.
Numerical feature distribution analysis.
Histograms.
Box plots.
Categorical feature analysis.
Correlation heatmap.
These visualizations were used to understand the structure of the dataset and relationships among the clinical attributes.

5. Feature Preparation
The input features were divided into numerical and categorical groups.

Numerical Features
age
resting bp s
cholesterol
max heart rate
oldpeak
Categorical Features
sex
chest pain type
fasting blood sugar
resting ecg
exercise angina
ST slope
6. Data Preprocessing
Different preprocessing techniques were applied according to the feature type.

For numerical features:

StandardScaler was used for feature scaling.
For categorical features:

OneHotEncoder was used to convert categorical variables into numerical representations.
The preprocessing operations were combined using ColumnTransformer.

7. Train-Test Splitting
The cleaned dataset was divided into training and testing sets.

Training data: 80%
Testing data: 20%
Split method: Stratified
Random state: 42
The stratified split was used to maintain the target-class distribution between the training and testing sets.

8. Model Development
Four machine learning classification models were implemented:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
Each model was integrated with the preprocessing pipeline.

9. Model Evaluation
The models were evaluated using:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
ROC-AUC
These metrics provide a broader evaluation than accuracy alone.

10. Model Comparison
The model performances were compared using the held-out test dataset.

11. Best Model Selection
The Random Forest Classifier was selected as the final model because it achieved the highest overall performance on the held-out test set, including the highest ROC-AUC and F1-Score among the evaluated models.

12. Feature Importance Analysis
Feature importance was extracted from the Random Forest model to understand which input variables contributed most strongly to the model's predictions.

Important model features included:

ST slope
Cholesterol
Maximum heart rate
Oldpeak
Chest pain type
Age
Resting blood pressure
Exercise angina
13. Cross-Source Consistency Check
An additional evaluation was performed using the UCI Heart Disease dataset.

The UCI dataset contains 303 records and was used to check whether the trained model produced consistent predictions on records represented in another source.

The UCI feature names were mapped to the corresponding feature names used by the primary dataset.

The UCI target was converted into a binary target:

0 → No Disease
1–4 → Disease
14. Dataset Overlap Verification
Before interpreting the UCI results as independent validation, an exact feature-level overlap check was performed.

The analysis found:

Primary training dataset unique feature rows: 918
UCI evaluation rows: 303
Exact overlapping rows: 303
Therefore, all 303 UCI records were found to overlap with records already present in the primary dataset.

Because of this overlap, the UCI evaluation is not considered independent external validation.

Instead, it is reported as a:

Cross-Source Consistency Check

This verification prevents the cross-source results from being incorrectly presented as independent validation.

15. Results Storage
The project stores important evaluation outputs inside the results/ directory.

The saved files include:

External validation prediction results
Final model performance results
Validation summary
ROC curve visualization
Data Quality Analysis
The original dataset contained:

1,190 rows
12 columns
0 missing values
272 duplicate rows
The duplicate records represented approximately 22.86% of the original dataset.

After removing duplicates:

918 unique records remained.
No duplicate records remained.
No missing values were present.
This cleaning step was performed before splitting the data and training the models.

Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis was performed to understand the characteristics of the dataset.

Target Distribution
The target variable was analyzed to understand the distribution between:

No Disease
Disease
After cleaning, the dataset contained:

No Disease: 410

max heart rate
oldpeak
Categorical Preprocessing
OneHotEncoder was applied to:

sex
chest pain type
fasting blood sugar
resting ecg
exercise angina
ST slope
The preprocessing pipeline was implemented using Scikit-learn's ColumnTransformer.

Train-Test Split
The cleaned dataset was divided using an 80:20 stratified split.

Training Set → 80%

Testing Set → 20%

Random State → 42

The test set was kept separate from model training and was used to obtain the main performance results.

Machine Learning Models
Four classification algorithms were evaluated.

1. Logistic Regression
Used as a baseline linear classification model.

2. Decision Tree
Used to model non-linear relationships through decision-based splitting.

3. Random Forest
An ensemble learning algorithm consisting of multiple decision trees.

4. Gradient Boosting
An ensemble technique that builds models sequentially to improve prediction performance.

Model Comparison
The following results were obtained on the held-out test set:

Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1-Score	ROC-AUC
Random Forest	90.22%	88.89%	94.12%	91.43%	93.92%
Gradient Boosting	89.13%	90.20%	90.20%	90.20%	93.19%
Logistic Regression	88.59%	87.16%	93.14%	90.05%	93.01%
Decision Tree	80.43%	82.35%	82.35%	82.35%	85.31%
Best Model
The Random Forest Classifier was selected as the final model.

Held-Out Test Set Performance
Accuracy: 90.22%
Precision: 88.89%
Recall: 94.12%
F1-Score: 91.43%
ROC-AUC: 93.92%
The model achieved a particularly high recall of 94.12%, meaning that it correctly identified most of the disease-positive cases in the held-out test set.

Confusion Matrix
The Random Forest confusion matrix on the held-out test set was:

[[70, 12],
 [ 6, 96]]
This represents:

True Negatives: 70
False Positives: 12
False Negatives: 6
True Positives: 96
The model correctly classified 166 out of 184 test cases.

Classification Report
The Random Forest classification performance on the held-out test set was:

Class	Precision	Recall	F1-Score	Support
No Disease	0.92	0.85	0.89	82
Disease	0.89	0.94	0.91	102
Accuracy			0.90	184
Feature Importance
Random Forest feature importance was analyzed to identify influential variables.

The most important model features included:

Feature	Importance
ST slope_1	0.1363
ST slope_2	0.1082
cholesterol	0.0955
max heart rate	0.0947
oldpeak	0.0881
chest pain type_4	0.0774
age	0.0703
resting bp s	0.0651
exercise angina_1	0.0524
exercise angina_0	0.0523
These values represent model-derived feature importance and should not be interpreted as medical causation.

Cross-Source Consistency Check
To further evaluate the trained model, the UCI Heart Disease dataset was used.

UCI Dataset
Dataset: UCI Heart Disease
Records: 303
Features used: 11
Target converted to binary:
0 → No Disease
1–4 → Disease
Cross-Source Results
The model produced the following results:

Accuracy: 97.36%
Precision: 97.12%
Recall: 97.12%
F1-Score: 97.12%
ROC-AUC: 98.62%
Confusion matrix:

[[160, 4],
 [  4, 135]]
However, an exact feature-level overlap analysis showed that:

Primary dataset unique rows : 918
UCI evaluation rows         : 303
Exact overlapping rows      : 303
Therefore, these results must not be interpreted as independent external validation.

They are retained as a cross-source consistency check because the UCI records overlap with the primary dataset.

ROC-AUC Analysis
ROC curves were used to evaluate the ability of the classifier to distinguish between disease and no-disease cases across different classification thresholds.

Held-Out Test Set
Random Forest ROC-AUC: 0.9392

Cross-Source Consistency Check
ROC-AUC: 0.9862

The cross-source ROC-AUC is reported only as a consistency result because the underlying records overlap with the primary dataset.

Conclusion
This project developed an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for heart disease prediction using patient clinical features.

The workflow included:

Dataset acquisition
Data quality assessment
Duplicate removal
Exploratory data analysis
Feature preprocessing
Model development
Model comparison
Performance evaluation
Feature importance analysis
Cross-source consistency checking
Four machine learning models were compared: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

Among these models, Random Forest achieved the best overall performance on the held-out test set, with:

90.22% Accuracy
88.89% Precision
94.12% Recall
91.43% F1-Score
93.92% ROC-AUC
The project also demonstrated responsible evaluation by checking the UCI dataset for overlap before interpreting its results. Since all 303 UCI records overlapped with records in the primary dataset, the UCI results were correctly classified as a cross-source consistency check rather than independent external validation.

Overall, the project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to structured clinical data for disease prediction while emphasizing appropriate evaluation, reproducibility, and the limitations of predictive models in healthcare.
